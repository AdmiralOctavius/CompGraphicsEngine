Direct3D - this is the rendering API

All rendering now is done with polygons
Polygons (3D Model) are composed of Vertices and Edges
Simplest Polygon - Triangles
Everything that gets rendered is rendered as triangles
Vertices Are just objects we send to the GPU
USUALLY they contain a point in space, 
	They also contain things like Color, TexturePosition, Normals, 

(Before Polygons  - Very original rendering used Bit Blits - 
	copying pixels directly into memory so they appear on screen
	Everything was just squares (like original pong))
